<p align="center">My project is a small game that I wrote in 3 days using React and Redux. The goal of the game is to complete it as quickly as possible.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>I wrote the project to try creating games on the web. I wanted to try to implement control, procedural generation and improve my knowledge of React and Redux.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to get your character to the end of the level as quickly as possible. When falling into lava, the character dies and the page is reloaded. All three levels must be completed in 40 seconds.</p>
<p>I used procedural generation to create the level map, making each level unique and random.</p>

<p>Levels 2 and 3 of the game remove the character from the screen, which is why you have to play blind. But in the place where your character is, shadows begin to flicker. At level 2, a character's shadow will flash with a 50% chance when moving, at level 3 - with a 25% chance.</p>

<hr/>
<p>It was just a quick and interesting project to try new things and consolidate the old.</p>
